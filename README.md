# 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm Isaac Anasonye — a Software Engineer based in Nigeria, with a strong focus on frontend development.

I specialize in building modern, responsive, and scalable web applications using **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Vue 3**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
On the backend, I work with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL** to support full-stack solutions.

I enjoy transforming complex UI logic such as canvas editors, real-time updates, charts, and infinite scroll into seamless, high-performance user experiences.  
I also make use of tools like **MobX**, **Redux**, **Framer Motion**, and **Chart.js** to enhance interactivity and design fluidity.
